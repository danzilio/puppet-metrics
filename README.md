# Puppet Metrics

**THIS WILL LIKELY MOVE TO A PUPPET-LINT PLUGIN**

This is intended to be a tool to calculate code quality metrics. Currently, this code barely works and can only calculate one metric: Assignment Branch Condition size. Have a look at `abc.rb` to see how this works.

## Assignment Branch Condition Size

ABC is a metric that represents the "size" of your code. See: http://www.softwarerenovation.com/ABCMetric.pdf
